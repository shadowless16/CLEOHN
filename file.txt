[21:04, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: BUSINESS PROTECTION
[21:10, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: TRADEMARK

A  trademark is a legal protection for your brand identity - the name, logo, slogan, symbol that customers use to recognize your business.

What a trademark does

* It protects your brand from being copied or used by others.
* It gives you  exclusive rights to use that name or logo in your line of business.
* It helps customers distinguish your goods or services from competitors.
* It adds value and credibility to your business - serious brands protect their identity.

What can be trademarked?

* Business or brand name
* Logo or symbol
* Tagline or slogan
* Product name
[21:10, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: There are 3 phases to a trademark registration

Phase 2: Acceptance and acknowledgement letters 

Here, the mark has been approved and you get acknowledgement and acceptance letters. This phase costs N60,000 and is delivered within 2 - 4 weeks. Many people stop here.

Phase 3: Trademark Certificate

To get a trademark certificate is not compulsory, but if you desire to get this certificate, it costs an extra N80,000 and takes an average of 1- 2 years

Please note that all documents are delivered as soft copies (PDF document)
[21:23, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: COPYRIGHT

Copyright is a legal protection for creative works - the original things you create with your mind and put into a fixed form.

If you created it and it’s original, copyright helps make sure no one steals it, copies it, or makes money from it without your permission.

What copyright protects

Copyright covers creative and intellectual content such as:

* Books, articles, blogs, and written content
* Music, lyrics, and sound recordings
* Videos, films, and scripts
* Photographs and artworks
* Software and apps
* Training materials, courses, and presentations

What copyright does

* Gives you the exclusive right to copy, distribute, perform, or sell your work
* Allows you to license or monetize your content
* Lets you take legal action if someone uses your work without permission
* Protects your income and creative effort



What copyright does NOT protect

* Ideas or concepts (only the expression of the idea)
* Names, logos, or slogans (those fall under trademark)
* Facts or common knowledge

Copyright vs registration

Copyright exists automatically, but registration is proof.
Registering your copyright strengthens your position in disputes, makes enforcement easier, and shows you’re serious about protecting your work.

Why this matters for business

If you create content—courses, social media posts, training manuals, videos—without copyright protection, people can copy your work, resell it, or dilute your brand. Creativity without protection is generosity you didn’t intend.

Copyright protects what you create.
Trademark protects how you are identified.

Copyright Certificate cost N55,000. Processing time 12 weeks


[21:39, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: BUSINESS COMPLAINCE
[21:43, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: Post-Incorporation Changes to CAC Documents

After a company is registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), business realities often change. Growth, restructuring, compliance updates, or regulatory requirements may make it necessary to amend or update company records.

These updates are known as post-incorporation changes. They ensure that your company’s information with CAC remains accurate, compliant, and legally valid.

Failing to update CAC records when changes occur can lead to penalties, invalid contracts, banking issues, and regulatory trouble.

Below are the common types of post-incorporation changes available:

Types of Post-Incorporation Changes

1. Change of Company Name

This involves altering the registered name of the company.
It is commonly done for rebranding, mergers, market repositioning, or to resolve name conflicts. Approval from CAC is required, and all company documents must be updated afterward.


2. Change of Registered Office Address

Companies are required to notify CAC when they relocate.
This update reflects a new operational or correspondence address and ensures official notices and legal documents reach the company correctly.

3. Change in Directors

This includes the appointment, resignation, or removal of directors.
It is required whenever there is a change in the company’s management structure to keep CAC records accurate and legally compliant.

 4. Change in Shareholders

This applies when shares are transferred, new shareholders are introduced, or existing shareholders exit the company.
It reflects changes in ownership and control of the company.

5. Increase or Reduction of Share Capital

Companies may increase share capital to raise funds or reduce it for restructuring purposes.
This change affects the company’s capital structure and must be approved and properly filed with CAC.

6. Change in Company Secretary

Where a company appoints a new secretary or removes an existing one, the update must be filed.
This is especially important for regulatory compliance and corporate governance.

7. Change in Nature of Business / Objects Clause

This allows a company to expand, modify, or completely change its business activities as stated in its Memorandum of Association.
It is necessary when a company diversifies or pivots into new sectors.

8. Allotment of Shares

This records the issuance of new shares to existing or new shareholders.
It is commonly done during investment rounds or internal restructuring.



 Why Post-Incorporation Changes Matter

Keeping CAC records updated:

* Protects your company legally
* Prevents compliance penalties
* Builds credibility with banks, investors, and regulators
* Ensures contracts and corporate actions remain valid

Our Role

We handle end-to-end post-incorporation filings with accuracy and speed, ensuring your business stays compliant while you focus on growth.

Let compliance work for you, not against you.

[22:07, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: SCUML

SCUML registration is a mandatory compliance requirement for certain businesses in Nigeria that are considered high-risk for money laundering or terrorism financing.

SCUML means Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering. It operates under the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

What is SCUML Registration?

SCUML registration is the process by which designated businesses enroll with the Federal Government to show they are known, monitored, and compliant with Nigeria’s anti-money laundering laws.

Once registered, your business receives a SCUML Certificate, which proves that you are operating transparently and legally.


Who Needs SCUML Registration?

SCUML applies to Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) including:

* Real estate companies and property consultants
* Hotels, guest houses, and hospitality businesses
* Car dealers (new or used)
* Luxury goods dealers
* Consultants and business service providers
* NGOs and non-profit organizations
* Mining, solid minerals, and precious stones dealers
* Logistics and clearing/forwarding companies (in some cases)

If your business handles large cash transactions or high-value assets SCUML is not optional.

Why SCUML Registration Is Important

1. It Is a Legal Requirement

Operating without SCUML registration when required exposes your business to:

* EFCC sanctions
* Heavy fines
* Possible shutdown
* Regulatory blacklisting

This is compliance, not branding - ignore it at your own risk.

2. Banks Will Not Fully Work With You Without It

Most banks now request SCUML certificates before:

* Opening or upgrading corporate accounts
* Processing large or frequent transactions
* Granting loans or facilities

No SCUML = stalled banking operations.

3. It Builds Credibility and Trust

SCUML registration shows:

* Your business is transparent
* You are not a front for illegal activity
* You meet government compliance standards

This matters to banks, investors, regulators, and corporate partners.

 4. It Protects Your Business From Compliance Trouble

Being registered helps you:

* Avoid sudden EFCC investigations
* Respond confidently to regulatory checks
* Operate without fear of compliance disruptions

Peace of mind has value.


5. It Is Often Required for Contracts and Licenses

Many government agencies, large corporations, and international partners now request SCUML certificates as part of their due diligence.

If you don’t have it, you simply won’t qualify.

If your business falls under SCUML requirements and you’re not registered, you’re operating on borrowed time.

SCUML registration is not about suspicion - ut’s about protection, credibility, and uninterrupted business operations.
[22:16, 03/01/2026] Mrs Miracle Cbc: An export license is an official authorization that allows a business to legally export goods from Nigeria to other countries. It confirms that the exporter is registered, compliant with trade regulations, and approved to participate in international trade.

In Nigeria, export licensing is regulated through the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and other relevant government agencies, depending on the nature of the goods being exported.

Simply put, no export license, no legitimate export business.

Who Needs an Export License?

Any individual or company intending to export goods from Nigeria, including:

* Agricultural produce exporters
* Solid minerals exporters
* Manufactured goods exporters
* Agro-processing and value-added product exporters
* Export trading companies

If you plan to sell Nigerian goods outside the country, an export license is not optional.

Why an Export License Is Important

1. Legal Authorization to Export

An export license gives your business the legal backing to operate as an exporter. Without it, your export activities are considered unauthorized and illegal.

2. Access to Ports and Customs Clearance

Exporters must present valid licensing documents during:

* Customs processing
* Port and terminal operations
* Shipping and logistics clearance

Without an export license, goods may be delayed, seized, or denied clearance.

3. Ability to Repatriate Export Proceeds

Licensed exporters can properly receive and repatriate foreign earnings through Nigerian banks in compliance with foreign exchange regulations.

This protects your funds and keeps you on the right side of the law.

4. Builds International Credibility

An export license proves to foreign buyers, logistics partners, and financial institutions that your business is legitimate and government-approved.

Serious buyers ask for this upfront.

5. Eligibility for Export Incentives and Support

Only registered exporters can access:

* Government export incentives
* Trade support programs
* Export financing and grants
* NEPC capacity-building initiatives

No license means no access.

Cleohn Limited can help you process your export license within 7 working days. Cost - 45,000
